# BitcoinMiner
Made using the hash function SHA256 which means it is 64 hex.

in simple if you're not familiar with mining,the first one to solve the puzzle wins the reward (Simplest way to explain)

difficulty is the number of zeros in the hash.

if you want to increase the difficulty increase the number but that will take more time since it needs more computing power.

you can execute using CMD (python (path of the program) Miner.py),terminal or simply using an ide.
